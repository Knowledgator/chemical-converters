## Introduction
Chemical-Converters serves as a foundational showcase of our 
technological capabilities within the chemical domain. 
The available models, which could be used in this library,
represent our entry-level offerings, designed to provide a 
glimpse into the potential applications of our advanced 
solutions. For access to our comprehensive suite of larger 
and more precise models, we invite interested parties to e
ngage directly with us. 

Developed by the brilliant minds at
Knowledgator, the library showcases the abilities of our 
chemical transformer models. Whether you're working on a 
research project, studying for an exam, or just exploring 
the chemical universe, Chemical-Converters is your go-to tool 🛠.

## Models
The models` architecture is based on Google MT5 with certain
modification to support different inputs and outputs. All available models 
are presented in the table:

| Model                        | Accuracy | Size(MB) | Task            |
|------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| SMILES2IUPAC-canonical-small | 75%      | 24       | SMILES to IUPAC |
| SMILES2IUPAC-canonical-base  | 86.9%    | 180      | SMILES to IUPAC |
| IUPAC2SMILES-canonical-small | 88.9%    | 24       | IUPAC to SMILES |
| IUPAC2SMILES-canonical-base  | 93.7%    | 180      | IUPAC to SMILES |

also, you can check the most resent models within the library:
```python
from chemicalconverters import NamesConverter

print(NamesConverter.available_models())
```
```text
{'knowledgator/SMILES2IUPAC-canonical-small': 'Small model for converting canonical SMILES to IUPAC with accuracy 75%, does not support isomeric or isotopic SMILES', 'knowledgator/SMILES2IUPAC-canonical-base': 'Medium model for converting canonical SMILES to IUPAC with accuracy 87%, does not support isomeric or isotopic SMILES', 'knowledgator/IUPAC2SMILES-canonical-small': 'Small model for converting IUPAC to canonical SMILES with accuracy 89%, does not support isomeric or isotopic SMILES', 'knowledgator/IUPAC2SMILES-canonical-base': 'Medium model for converting IUPAC to canonical SMILES with accuracy 94%, does not support isomeric or isotopic SMILES'}
```

## Quickstart
Firstly, install the library:
```commandline
pip install chemical-converters
```
### SMILES to IUPAC
You can choose pretrained model from table in the section "Models", 
but we recommend to use model "knowledgator/SMILES2IUPAC-canonical-base".
#### ! Preferred IUPAC style
To choose the preferred IUPAC style, place style tokens before 
your SMILES sequence.

| Style Token | Description                                                                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<BASE>`    | The most known name of the substance, sometimes is the mixture of traditional and systematic style |
| `<SYST>`    | The totally systematic style without trivial names                                                 |
| `<TRAD>`    | The style is based on trivial names of the parts of substances                                     |

#### To perform simple translation, follow the example:
```python
from chemicalconverters import NamesConverter

converter = NamesConverter(model_name="knowledgator/SMILES2IUPAC-canonical-base")
print(converter.smiles_to_iupac('CCO'))
print(converter.smiles_to_iupac(['<SYST>CCO', '<TRAD>CCO', '<BASE>CCO']))
```
```text
['ethanol']
['ethanol', 'ethanol', 'ethanol']
```
#### Processing in batches:
```python
from chemicalconverters import NamesConverter

converter = NamesConverter(model_name="knowledgator/SMILES2IUPAC-canonical-base")
print(converter.smiles_to_iupac(["<BASE>C=CC=C" for _ in range(10)], num_beams=1, 
                                process_in_batch=True, batch_size=1000))
```
```text
['buta-1,3-diene', 'buta-1,3-diene'...]
```
#### Validation SMILES to IUPAC translations
It's possible to validate the translations by reverse translation into IUPAC
and calculating Tanimoto similarity of two molecules fingerprints.
````python
from chemicalconverters import NamesConverter

converter = NamesConverter(model_name="knowledgator/SMILES2IUPAC-canonical-base")
print(converter.smiles_to_iupac('CCO', validate=True))
````
````text
['ethanol'] 1.0
````
The larger is Tanimoto similarity, the more is probability, that the prediction was correct.

You can also process validation manually:
```python
from chemicalconverters import NamesConverter

validation_model = NamesConverter(model_name="knowledgator/IUPAC2SMILES-canonical-base")
print(NamesConverter.validate_iupac(input_sequence='CCO', predicted_sequence='ethanol', validation_model=validation_model))
```
```text
1.0
```
!Note validation was not implemented in processing in batches.

### IUPAC to SMILES
You can choose pretrained model from table in the section "Models", 
but we recommend to use model "knowledgator/IUPAC2SMILES-canonical-base".
#### To perform simple translation, follow the example:
```python
from chemicalconverters import NamesConverter

converter = NamesConverter(model_name="knowledgator/IUPAC2SMILES-canonical-base")
print(converter.smiles_to_iupac('ethanol'))
print(converter.smiles_to_iupac(['ethanol', 'ethanol', 'ethanol']))
```
```text
['CCO']
['CCO', 'CCO', 'CCO']
```
#### Processing in batches:
```python
from chemicalconverters import NamesConverter

converter = NamesConverter(model_name="knowledgator/IUPAC2SMILES-canonical-base")
print(converter.smiles_to_iupac(["buta-1,3-diene" for _ in range(10)], num_beams=1, 
                                process_in_batch=True, batch_size=1000))
```
```text
['<SYST>C=CC=C', '<SYST>C=CC=C'...]
```
Our models also predict IUPAC styles from the table:

| Style Token | Description                                                                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<BASE>`    | The most known name of the substance, sometimes is the mixture of traditional and systematic style |
| `<SYST>`    | The totally systematic style without trivial names                                                 |
| `<TRAD>`    | The style is based on trivial names of the parts of substances                                     |
